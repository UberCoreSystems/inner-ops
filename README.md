Mental Fitness Operating System for High-Performing Men

Inner Ops is a dark, focused journaling and relapse radar app designed for men pursuing mental clarity, discipline, and identity realignment. Built in React with Firebase backend, this system blends self-assessment, relapse tracking, and journaling into a single, distraction-free mental ops center.

Core Modules:
🔒 Relapse Radar – monitor emotional regressions and identity slips

📓 Journal – guided + freeform logging

💀 Kill List – eliminate patterns, behaviors, substances

🕳️ Black Mirror – Tracks compulsive, mindless phone use while simultaneously acting as a reflection chamber—forcing users to confront avoidance patterns, fractured focus, and their unconscious digital behaviors.

🧭 Archetype System – track evolution of personal identity

⚙️ Built with: React 18, TailwindCSS, Firebase, Framer Motion

This project is part of a larger mission to help men reclaim inner sovereignty and reject the comfort cult of modern self-help.
